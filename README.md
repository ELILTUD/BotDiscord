# RawChat ðŸ”ˆ

RawChat is a simple application that allows users to communicate in real-time using an overlay on OBS linked to Discord.
Inspired by Cacabox's Livechat, demo available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs4zvCv1Ir8).

## Project demo
Web view with a sample background on the left, and Discord chat on the right.
> [!NOTE]  
> Demo was done during indev, might not reflect final product. (especially in regards to the video display, message timings...)
> 
> The gradient background is exclusive to the debugging view - it's transparent in OBS.
